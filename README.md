# My test for Gorilla Logic's Senior Node.js Developer

## Instructions
- Create a new `npm` package with the naming convention '[your-name]-[your-lastname]-gorilla-logic-test'.
- The package should run a file called `main.js` on `npm start`.
- The package should have `lodash` within its dependencies.
- When run using `npm start`, the package should be allowed to receive an indefinite number of arguments and sort them in descending order using `lodash` and it should print the resulting array in the terminal.
- Within `main.js`, write a function called `my_own_original_function`, impress us with your JS skills, the function can be as simple or as complex as you wish, but it *must* return a string.
- If we run the command `npm run moof` we should get the resulting string of `my_own_original_function`.
